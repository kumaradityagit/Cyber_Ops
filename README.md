# CyberOps‚ö°AI-Driven-Automated-Malware-Analysis-System
Welcome to **CyberOps GRID 2077** ‚Äî a futuristic, fully-automated cybersecurity threat detection and incident response system.

This project integrates:
- Static Malware Analysis (VirusTotal Intelligence)
- Dynamic Malware Behavior Execution & Monitoring
- Real-Time Process Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning (Isolation Forest)
- Threat Scoring Consolidation
- Automated Incident Response (process kill, network isolation, backup)
- Master Threat Reporting (PDF Generation + Google Drive Upload)
- Twilio SMS Alert Integration

All modules operate from a **centralized TRON-styled CLI Control System** for smooth operation, real-time decision making, and seamless threat reporting.
